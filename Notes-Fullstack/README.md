# NotesApp

This webapp allows users to perform CRUD actions to their notebooks and notes.

the table relationship is that a user can have many notebooks and a notebooks can have many notes.

we did minimal work for authentication since it was not covered yet at the time we were building this project. That means the user id is not being stored in a session or cookies, if you refresh the page you would have to log in again.
